# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will churn using machine learning models.

## Dataset
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset

## Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Train-test split
- Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

## Results
- Logistic Regression achieved ~78% accuracy
- Random Forest improved churn recall and F1-score
- Random Forest performed better for identifying churn customers

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
